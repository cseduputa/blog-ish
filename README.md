This project involves developing accessible websites that can be used by everyone, regardless of physical disablitily or impairment.

I will be developing two different websites. One of them will be developed following the guidelines for accessibility as documented in the WCAG.

The other one will be developed without following the guidelines.

Both sites will then be compared and evaluated based on their functionality in terms of usability. I will focus on evaluating the benefits that the accessible site offers over the non-accessible sites.
